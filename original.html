                <p>
                    Multifaceted professional, combining a Mechanical Engineering Bachelor's, a Data Analytics Master's, and completion of the Columbia Full Stack Coding Bootcamp. With a robust background in construction, architectural, and engineering industries, I have accrued eight years of hands-on experience, taking on leadership roles that showcase my technical prowess.
                    My journey extends beyond the professional realm—I am a dedicated math enthusiast, finding beauty in the precision and complexities of numerical challenges. Beyond the analytical mindset, my passions unfold in two distinct realms—traveling and motorcycles. As an avid traveler, I thrive on exploring diverse cultures and landscapes, gaining insights that enrich my worldview. Simultaneously, the thrill of riding motorcycles fuels my adventurous spirit, creating a dynamic balance in my life.
                    This combination of academic achievements, professional expertise, and personal passions shapes a holistic and versatile individual. I am eager to leverage this diverse skill set to contribute meaningfully to the ever-evolving landscape of technology and engineering. Let's connect and explore how we can create innovative solutions and embark on exciting journeys together.
